# Populist Leaders and the Economy: *Can Populism Ever Be Good Economics?*

This repository contains the materials for our empirical extension of Funke et al. (2023), investigating whether populist leadership can sometimes yield positive long-term economic outcomes. We replicate and extend their Synthetic Control Method (SCM) analysis, focusing on cases of “democratic populism,” and test if institutional checks can mitigate populism’s economic costs.

The extension investigates whether certain populist leaders—classified as democratic populists—can generate positive long-run economic outcomes, in contrast to the general negative effects of populism found by Funke et al. (2023). Inspired by Rodrik (2018a), the motivation is to explore whether populism, when paired with strong democratic institutions, can lift policy constraints and foster economic growth. This idea is tested using historical cases such as Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR), Alan García, and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
